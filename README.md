# ⚔️ Melee Combat & Locomotion Assignment

This project is a technical assessment completed for an internship application. The goal was to implement specific gameplay mechanics using the Third Person Template within a strict timeline (1-2 days).

## 📋 Assignment Requirements
* **Locomotion:** Implement 8-directional movement (WASD).
* **Speed Control:** Sprint/Walk functionality mapped to `Left Shift` (Hold/Toggle).
* **Combat:** Melee sword attack system mapped to `LMB`.
* **Assets:** Integration of custom animations (Mixamo/Marketplace).

## 🚀 Implemented Features
### Core Mechanics
* **Advanced Locomotion:** Created a Blend Space driven movement system supporting 8-way motion (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Diagonals).
* **Combat System:** Implemented a combo-based light attack system with weapon collision detection.
* **State Management:** Sprint/Walk toggle logic using character movement component modifiers.

### 🌟 Bonus Features (Extras)
* **Enemy AI:** Basic AI Controller that detects the player, chases, and performs attacks when in range.
* **Health System:** Floating UI Health Bars for enemies that update dynamically upon taking damage.
* **Custom Character:** Retargeted Mixamo animations to a custom mesh, replacing the default UE mannequin.

## 🛠 Tools Used
* **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
* **Logic:** Blueprints / C++
